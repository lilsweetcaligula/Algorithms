import LinkedList

# Problem description:      Find a string pattern represented as a linked list in a target linked list.
# Solution time complexity: O(n^2)
# Comments:                 A brute force solution w/o any optimizations. Simply traverse a list looking for the pattern.
#                           If the node traversing the "pattern" list ever reaches the end (i.e. pnode == null), it is in
#                           the list. The case where a pnode may be equal to null due to the pattern being null, is ruled
#                           out by a test at the beginning of the function.

# Linked List Node inside the LinkedList module is defined as:
#
#   class Node:
#       def __init__(self, val, nxt=None):
#           self.val = val
#           self.nxt = nxt
#
